## Usage
Install packages with:
```shell
$ npm install && bower install
```

Run the development server with:
```shell
$ grunt server
```
This will build the project and serve it at `http://localhost:9000/`. It will also watch for changes in `src` directory and reload the page.

To build the project without running a server run:
```shell
$ grunt
```

To deploy the project, just deploy the `public` directory.
